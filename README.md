Hello! My name is :sparkles:Andressa:sparkles:  
  
I'm a Aerospace Engineering dropout that taught myself Software Engineering and works in the area for several years now. I have a cool job - I work as Software Quality Engineer at Red Hat - and I think Open Source rocks! I believe *knowledge must be shared and accessible to everyone*! I love learning new things and this is one of the reasons why I love coding so much!  
  
My favorite programming language is Python :snake: and besides Python I also work with Golang and Ruby.
  
Also, I write stuff sometimes [in my blog](https://andressa.dev/) :computer: and if you like, follow me at Bluesky [@andressadotpy.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/andressadotpy.bsky.social)!

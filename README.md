Hello! My name is :sparkles:Andressa:sparkles:  
  
I'm a self-taught Software Engineer and I work as Software Quality Engineer at Red Hat. I believe *knowledge must be shared and accessible to everyone*! I love building new things and this is one of the reasons why I love coding so much!  
  
My favorite programming language is Python and I'm learning Golang!
  
Also, I like writing blog posts in my website [andressa.dev](https://andressa.dev/) :computer: and if you like, follow me at twitter [@andressadotpy](https://twitter.com/andressadotpy)!
